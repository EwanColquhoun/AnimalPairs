## Site Structure
Animal Pairs is designed to be simply to use. It has one main page and within that page it has 3 pop-up windows (modals). <br>
On opening the site you are greeted with Welcome pop-up that describes the rules of the game as well as offering the user a choice of game difficulty in the form of three buttons. Additionally there is a button to link to the sound menu popup. The Welcome pop-up can be accessed at any time via the 'Rules' button.<br>

The sound pop-up can be accessed at any time via the volume icon, it has a volume slider and a mute toggle switch.<br>

The Congratulations pop-up is displayed when the user has completed the game. It shows the score, time taken and gives the user the option ot start again at a difficulty of their choosing. 

There is a reset button at the bottom of the deck of cards.

## Design Choices
* ### Typography
    * The main heading is 'Fredericka the Great' in the cursive style. This helps the user get an idea as to what the game is about. 
    * The font for the rest of the site is 'Exo' in the san-serif style. It appears informal yet easy to read at all sizes and weights.

[Back to top](<#contents>)
* ### Colour Scheme
    * The colour schemes chosen for Animal Pairs were primarily chosen to capture the users eye and imagination. They are bright and vibrant colours to enhance the experience without detracting from the game itself.

Here are some examples of the colours:
* Main background

    * The sound menu controls the volume of the site and gives the user the option to mute the sounds all together. 
    * The user can access the sound menu from the sounds button on either the welcome pop-up (In the top right corner) or the main game page (next to the timer).

* ### The Game
    * The game itself is made up of cards that the user has to turn over. The aim is to match two cards together until the whole 'deck' is matched.
    * The amount of cards on the deck depends on the level of difficulty selected. 
    * There are some basic animations and sounds that interact with the user to enhance the in game user experience and to encourage further use. 
    * The below picture depicts the game board with two cards turned over. They are unmatched so will turn back over with a slight delay.

    * To exit the congratulations pop-up the user needs to click anywhere on the screen.
